## üìò Introduction
This repository documents my journey learning C++. It contains code examples, exercises, and small projects as I build a strong foundation in the language, with the long-term goal of becoming an embedded software engineer.

## üéØ Goal
My aim is to transition into embedded software development. I‚Äôm excited by the challenge of writing efficient, low-level code that interacts directly with hardware.

## üîß Real-World Experience and Relevance
As a Controls Technician, I‚Äôve worked hands-on with HVAC systems‚Äîinstalling and troubleshooting sensors, actuators, and controllers. I've measured voltages, diagnosed control signals, and wired entire systems from schematics. This real-world experience has given me a deep appreciation for how physical hardware behaves and how systems need to respond reliably in the field.

This background is highly relevant to embedded software engineering:
- **Sensors & Actuators**: I understand how devices operate and how software must interact with them through inputs and outputs.
- **Voltage & Signal Measurement**: I've worked directly with analog and digital signals, which are fundamental to embedded development.
- **Control Logic**: I‚Äôve configured programmable controllers and tuned PID loops‚Äîskills that translate naturally to embedded control algorithms.
- **Wiring & Schematics**: My familiarity with electrical diagrams and physical wiring makes it easier to understand circuit-level interactions with microcontrollers.

By learning C++, I aim to move from configuring hardware to programming it‚Äîbringing both the software and hardware sides together in my work.

## Architecture
- Memory/Devices - External Memory, Embedded

- Instruction Set - RISC, CISC. 
RISC - Reduced instruction Set computing focuses on smaller, simplier set of instructions, optimized for speed and efficiency
CISC - Complex instruction set computing utilizes a larger, more complex set of instrucctions allow for more operations per instruction but might be a little slower

Memory Architecture - Harvard, Von Neumann
Harvard - Separate memory spaces for instruction and data. Biggest difference between Harvard and Von Neumann is how the CPU fetches instructions and data.

Von Neumann - Uses a single memory space for both instructions and data. Instructions and data reside in the same memory space accessed by a single address bus or data bus
Address bus - Carries the location (Address) of the data being accessed. Tells the memory where to look. CPU to the memory or other components. Unidirectional only carries from CPU to memory
Data bus - Transmits the actual data to or from that location. Provides what to put at the address. bidirectional, data flows in both directions from CPU to memory (Read/Write)
Control bus - Carries the control signals that coordinate the activies of the data and address buses. Read/Write operation and can include timing information. Unidireciton or bidirectional

Example: CPU places the memory address on the address bus, CPU sends a read singal on the control bus, the memory at the address places the data on the data bus, and the CPU receieves the data.
