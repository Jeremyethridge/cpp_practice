## 📘 Introduction
This repository documents my journey learning C++. It contains code examples, exercises, and small projects as I build a strong foundation in the language, with the long-term goal of becoming an embedded software engineer.

## 🎯 Goal
My aim is to transition into embedded software development. I’m excited by the challenge of writing efficient, low-level code that interacts directly with hardware.

## 🔧 Real-World Experience and Relevance
As a Controls Technician, I’ve worked hands-on with HVAC systems—installing and troubleshooting sensors, actuators, and controllers. I've measured voltages, diagnosed control signals, and wired entire systems from schematics. This real-world experience has given me a deep appreciation for how physical hardware behaves and how systems need to respond reliably in the field.

This background is highly relevant to embedded software engineering:
- **Sensors & Actuators**: I understand how devices operate and how software must interact with them through inputs and outputs.
- **Voltage & Signal Measurement**: I've worked directly with analog and digital signals, which are fundamental to embedded development.
- **Control Logic**: I’ve configured programmable controllers and tuned PID loops—skills that translate naturally to embedded control algorithms.
- **Wiring & Schematics**: My familiarity with electrical diagrams and physical wiring makes it easier to understand circuit-level interactions with microcontrollers.

By learning C++, I aim to move from configuring hardware to programming it—bringing both the software and hardware sides together in my work.
